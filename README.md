# Football-Guys
CMPSC 445 Machine Learning Final Project

# Introduction
Welcome to the Football Guys project! Here, we are creating a machine learning application that utilizes large NFL datasets ranging from player info to game outcomes. These are arranged in excel files that were found from Kaggle. Our main goal of Football Guys is to predict how well a team will perform during a given time. It may come in handy in times of drafting fantasy teams for trading players during the season or general sports betting. To implement these ideas into our project, we can use a few concepts that we learned in class for processing these datasets for training and testing. We currently plan on using PCA, KNN, KMeans and a simple GUI to keep it as compact as we can. (write more later)
